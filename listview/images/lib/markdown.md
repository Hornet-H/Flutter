# Markdown Example
Markdown allows you to easily include formatted text, images, and even formatted Dart code into your app.

## Styling
Style text as _italic_, __bold__, or `inline code`.

- Use bulleted lists
- To better clarify
- Your points

Formatted Dart code looks really pretty too. This is an example of how to create your own Markdown widget:

    new Block(
      padding: new EdgeDims.all(16.0),
      children: <Widget>[new Markdown(data: data)]
    )

Enjoy!
